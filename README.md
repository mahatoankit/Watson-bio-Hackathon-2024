## Introduction

Every year, millions are diagnosed with brain tumors, facing significant challenges in their treatment. NeuroVision aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and speed, providing healthcare professionals with the tools needed to make informed decisions swiftly.

## Why NeuroVision?

- **Advanced Technology**: Utilizes AI-powered algorithms for precise imaging and diagnosis.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces diagnostic time significantly.
- **Robust Performance**: Operates with minimal human intervention.
- **Scalable**: Optimized for use in diverse clinical settings.

## Model Performance

NeuroVision employs advanced algorithms to classify brain tumors with impressive accuracy:

| Tumor Type                 | Accuracy |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Pilocytic Astrocytoma      | 87%      |
| Medulloblastoma            | 93%      |
| Glioblastoma               | 95%      |
| Metastatic Brain Tumor     | 89%      |
| Meningioma                 | 92%      |
| Encephalitis               | 85%      |

### Model Predictions and Symptoms

Each classification includes crucial symptom information:

- **Pilocytic Astrocytoma**: Symptoms include seizures, persistent headaches, nausea.
- **Medulloblastoma**: Common symptoms are persistent headaches, nausea, balance issues.
- **Glioblastoma**: Symptoms may include headaches, seizures, memory loss.
- **Meningioma**: Symptoms involve headaches, hearing loss, cognitive difficulties.
- **Metastatic Tumor**: Symptoms can be headaches, cognitive changes, nausea.
  
## Applications of NeuroVision

1. **Early Diagnosis**: Rapid identification for timely treatment.
2. **Second Opinion**: Acts as a trusted diagnostic tool to reduce error rates.
3. **Research and Development**: Supports clinical trials and innovative research.
4. **Education and Training**: Serves as a resource for medical education institutions.
